"""
Comprehensive test suite for ListRoomCommand module.

This module contains extensive unit tests for the ListRoomCommand class,
covering all aspects of the room listing command execution including:
- Successful listing operations with various data scenarios
- Empty booking list handling
- Database operation failures
- Table formatting integration
- Exception handling
- Edge cases and boundary conditions
- Output verification
- Thread safety considerations

The tests use mocking to isolate the command logic from external dependencies
like the database and table formatter, ensuring fast and reliable unit testing.
