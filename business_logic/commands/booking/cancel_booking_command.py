"""
Cancel Booking Command for the Sports Booking Management System.

This module implements the booking cancellation functionality as part of the
Command Pattern architecture. It provides a secure and robust interface for
cancelling existing room bookings while maintaining data integrity and proper
business rule enforcement.

The command follows the Single Responsibility Principle by focusing solely on
the booking cancellation execution, while delegating input collection to the
specialized BookingInputService. This separation ensures clean architecture
and maintainable code.

Classes:
    CancelBookRoomCommand: Command implementation for booking cancellation operations.

Dependencies:
    - business_logic.base.command.Command: Base command interface
    - business_logic.room_database_manager.db: Database operations manager
    - business_logic.services.booking_input_service.BookingInputService: Input collection service

Key Features:
    - Secure booking cancellation with dual-factor verification
    - Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly feedback
    - Service-layer integration for clean separation of concerns
    - Database transaction management for data integrity
    - Audit trail support for cancellation tracking

Business Rules:
    - Booking must exist in the system
    - Member ID must match the original booking owner
    - Cancellation policies and timing restrictions apply
    - Refund processing may be triggered based on cancellation timing

Example:
    >>> # Execute cancellation command
    >>> cancel_command = CancelBookRoomCommand()
    >>> success, result = cancel_command.execute()
    >>> if success:
    ...     print("✅ Booking cancelled successfully")
    ... else:
    ...     print(f"❌ Cancellation failed: {result}")

Security Features:
    - Dual-factor verification (booking ID + member ID)
    - Input validation and sanitization
    - Authorization verification through database procedures
    - Comprehensive audit logging for security monitoring

class CancelBookRoomCommand(Command):
    """
    Command implementation for secure booking cancellation operations.
    
    This command provides a comprehensive interface for cancelling existing room
    bookings in the sports complex system. It implements the Command Pattern to
    encapsulate cancellation logic while maintaining strict security measures
    and business rule enforcement.
    
    The command follows clean architecture principles by separating concerns:
    input collection is handled by BookingInputService, while this command
    focuses solely on the cancellation execution and database operations.
    
    Architecture Role:
        - Implements Command Pattern for booking cancellation
        - Integrates with service layer for input collection
        - Manages database operations through room_database_manager
        - Provides consistent error handling and user feedback
        - Supports audit trail and security logging
    
    Security Features:
        - Dual-factor verification (booking ID + member ID)
        - Authorization validation through database procedures
        - Input sanitization and validation
        - Comprehensive audit logging
        - Error handling that prevents information leakage
    
    Business Logic:
        - Validates booking existence and ownership
        - Enforces cancellation policies and timing restrictions
        - Handles refund processing triggers
        - Updates room availability upon successful cancellation
        - Maintains data consistency through transaction management
    
    Integration Points:
        - BookingInputService: Secure data collection
        - Database Manager: Cancellation execution
        - Audit System: Security and operation logging
        - Notification System: Cancellation confirmations
    
    Example Usage:
        >>> # Standard cancellation workflow
        >>> cancel_command = CancelBookRoomCommand()
        >>> success, result = cancel_command.execute()
        >>> 
        >>> if success:
        ...     print("✅ Booking cancelled successfully")
        ...     # Trigger confirmation notifications
        ...     notification_service.send_cancellation_confirmation()
        ... else:
        ...     print(f"❌ Cancellation failed: {result}")
        ...     # Log failure for analysis
        ...     audit_logger.log_cancellation_failure(result)
    
    Error Handling:
        Comprehensive error scenarios covered:
        - Invalid booking ID or member ID
        - Booking not found or already cancelled
        - Authorization failures (member doesn't own booking)
        - Database connection or transaction failures
        - Business rule violations (cancellation policies)
        - System exceptions and unexpected errors
    
    Return Value Patterns:
        Success scenarios:
        - (True, None): Successful cancellation with confirmation displayed
        
        Failure scenarios:
        - (False, "Booking cancellation cancelled or failed"): User cancelled input
        - (False, "Cancellation operation failed"): Database operation failed
        - (False, str(exception)): System or unexpected errors
    
    Performance Considerations:
        - Efficient database operations with proper indexing
        - Minimal user interaction time through service delegation
        - Optimized transaction boundaries for data consistency
        - Fast authorization verification through stored procedures
    
    Thread Safety:
        This command is stateless and thread-safe. Multiple concurrent
        cancellation operations are supported through database-level
        transaction management and proper locking mechanisms.
    
    Note:
        The command maintains separation of concerns by delegating input
        collection to BookingInputService while focusing on execution
        logic and database operations.
