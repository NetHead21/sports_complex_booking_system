        Success scenarios:
        - (True, None): Bookings displayed successfully, data presented to user
        
        Note: This command always returns success as it's a display operation.
        Any data retrieval issues are handled internally with appropriate
        user messaging, maintaining consistent command pattern behavior.
    
    Security Considerations:
        - Read-only database operations with no data modification risk
        - No user input validation required for display-only functionality
        - Safe data presentation without sensitive information exposure
        - Audit-friendly operations with minimal security impact
        - No authentication required for general booking visibility
    
    Data Integrity:
        - No data modification operations performed
        - Transactional consistency maintained through read-only access
        - Real-time data display reflecting current system state
        - Accurate information presentation without data transformation
    
    Thread Safety:
        This command is stateless and completely thread-safe. Multiple
        concurrent listing operations are fully supported without any
        synchronization concerns or data consistency issues.
    
    Note:
        The command maintains separation of concerns by delegating data
        formatting to the presentation layer while focusing solely on
        the execution logic and database coordination.

        Execute the room listing command to display all current bookings.

        This method orchestrates the complete booking information display workflow,
        including data retrieval from the database and professional formatting for
        user presentation. It provides a comprehensive view of all active room
        bookings in the sports complex system.

        The execution follows a streamlined process optimized for performance:
        1. Retrieve all booking data from the database
        2. Format the data using professional table formatting
        3. Display the formatted information to the user
        4. Return success confirmation following Command Pattern standards
