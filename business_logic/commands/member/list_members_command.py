    Sorting Options and Performance:
        Available Sorting Fields:
            - member_since: Registration date (default, chronological)
            - name: Alphabetical by member name
            - email: Alphabetical by email address
            - member_id: Alphanumeric by member identifier
            - Custom fields: Additional database columns as needed
        
        Performance Optimization:
            - Database-level sorting for efficiency
            - Indexed sorting fields for fast query execution
            - Minimal memory usage for large datasets
            - Optimized query plans for various sort orders
    
    Thread Safety:
        This command is stateless and completely thread-safe. Multiple
        concurrent listing operations with different sorting options are
        fully supported without any synchronization concerns or data
        consistency issues.
    
    Note:
        The command maintains separation of concerns by delegating data
        formatting to the presentation layer while focusing on execution
        logic, database coordination, and flexible sorting capabilities.

        Initialize the ListMembersCommand with configurable sorting options.

        This constructor allows for flexible member data display with customizable
        sorting criteria. It provides administrators and users with the ability to
        organize member information according to their specific needs and workflows.

        The sorting functionality is implemented at the database level for optimal
        performance, ensuring fast query execution even with large member datasets.
        The default sorting by registration date provides chronological member views.

        Args:
            order_by (str, optional): Sorting criteria for member display.
                Defaults to "member_since" for chronological organization.
                
                Available Options:
                    - "member_since": Sort by registration date (default)
                    - "name": Alphabetical sorting by member name
                    - "email": Alphabetical sorting by email address
                    - "member_id": Alphanumeric sorting by member identifier
                    - Custom fields: Additional database columns as supported

        Attributes:
            order_by (str): Stored sorting criteria for use during execution.
                Used by the database query to determine result ordering.

        Sorting Benefits:
            Chronological (member_since):
                - Shows membership growth patterns
                - Identifies newest and oldest members
                - Supports membership analytics and reporting
                - Default option for administrative oversight

            Alphabetical (name):
                - Quick member lookup by name
                - Improved user experience for member search
                - Natural ordering for directory-style displays
                - Optimal for member verification workflows

            Email-based (email):
                - Contact information organization
                - Duplicate email detection and verification
                - Communication workflow optimization
                - Email-based member lookup support

            Identifier-based (member_id):
                - System-level member organization
                - Database record correlation and analysis
                - Technical administration workflows
                - Audit trail and logging correlation

        Performance Considerations:
            - Database-level sorting for optimal query performance
            - Indexed sorting fields for fast execution
            - Minimal memory overhead for large datasets
            - Efficient query plan optimization for various sort orders

        Example Usage:
            >>> # Default chronological sorting
            >>> command = ListMembersCommand()
            >>> # Equivalent to: ListMembersCommand(order_by="member_since")
            
            >>> # Alphabetical sorting by name
            >>> command = ListMembersCommand(order_by="name")
            
            >>> # Email-based sorting
            >>> command = ListMembersCommand(order_by="email")
            
            >>> # Member ID sorting
            >>> command = ListMembersCommand(order_by="member_id")

        Validation and Error Handling:
            - Invalid sorting criteria handled gracefully with fallback
            - Default sorting applied for unsupported field names
            - Database-level validation for field existence
            - Error logging for troubleshooting and analysis

        Thread Safety:
            The constructor is thread-safe and creates independent command
            instances with isolated sorting configurations. Multiple commands
            with different sorting options can be used concurrently.

        Note:
            The sorting field is validated during execution to ensure
            database compatibility and prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
