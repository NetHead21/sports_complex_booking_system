Add Member Command for the Sports Booking Management System.

This module implements the member registration functionality as part of the Command Pattern
architecture. It provides a comprehensive interface for creating new member accounts in
the sports complex system while maintaining data integrity, validation standards, and proper
audit trail management throughout the member registration process.

The command follows clean architecture principles by separating member creation execution
from input collection and validation concerns. It leverages the MemberInputService for
secure data collection and member object creation, while the database manager handles
the actual persistence operations with comprehensive safety measures.

Security Features:
    - Input validation and sanitization through service layer
    - Data integrity verification before database persistence
    - Duplicate member detection and prevention mechanisms
    - Comprehensive audit logging for security monitoring
    - Safe registration procedures with rollback capabilities

Business Rules:
    - Member ID uniqueness must be maintained across the system
    - All required member information must be provided and validated
    - Email addresses must follow valid format standards
    - Registration data must be complete and accurate
    - Audit trail must be created for compliance requirements

Example:
    >>> # Execute member registration command
    >>> add_command = AddMembersCommand()
    >>> success, result = add_command.execute()
    >>> if success:
    ...     print("✅ Member registered successfully")
    ... else:
    ...     print(f"❌ Registration failed: {result}")

Data Validation Features:
    - Member ID format validation and uniqueness checking
    - Email format validation using industry standards
    - Required field validation ensuring complete registration
    - Input sanitization preventing malicious content
    - Business rule enforcement for registration policies

Performance Considerations:
    - Efficient database operations with minimal overhead
