"""
Delete Member Command for the Sports Booking Management System.

This module implements the member deletion functionality as part of the Command Pattern
architecture. It provides a secure and comprehensive interface for removing existing
members from the sports complex system while maintaining data integrity, audit trails,
and proper business rule enforcement throughout the deletion process.

The command follows clean architecture principles by separating deletion execution
from input collection and validation concerns. It leverages the MemberInputService
for secure data collection and confirmation, while the database manager handles
the actual deletion operations with comprehensive safety measures.

    DeleteMembersCommand: Command implementation for secure member deletion operations.

Dependencies:
    - business_logic.base.command.Command: Base command interface
    - business_logic.member_database_manager.db: Database operations manager
    - business_logic.services.member_input_service.MemberInputService: Input collection service

Key Features:
    - Secure member deletion with confirmation workflows
    - Comprehensive data integrity validation and protection
    - Service-layer integration for clean separation of concerns
    - Advanced safety measures and rollback capabilities

Security Features:
    - Multi-step confirmation process for deletion authorization
    - Input validation and sanitization through service layer
    - Referential integrity checking before deletion execution
    - Comprehensive audit logging for security monitoring
    - Safe deletion procedures with data protection measures

Business Rules:
    - Member must exist in the system before deletion
    - Active bookings must be handled appropriately
    - Cascade deletion rules for related data cleanup
    - Audit trail preservation for compliance requirements
    - Authorization verification for deletion permissions

Example:
    >>> # Execute member deletion command
    >>> delete_command = DeleteMembersCommand()
    >>> success, result = delete_command.execute()
    >>> if success:
    ...     print("✅ Member deleted successfully")
    ... else:
    ...     print(f"❌ Deletion failed: {result}")

Data Protection Measures:
    - Referential integrity validation before deletion
    - Cascade deletion handling for related records
    - Backup and recovery support for accidental deletions
    - Soft deletion options for data preservation
    - Comprehensive audit trails for compliance monitoring

Performance Considerations:
    - Efficient database operations with minimal overhead
    - Optimized deletion procedures with proper indexing
    - Transaction management for data consistency
    - Minimal user interaction time through service delegation
    - Fast validation and confirmation workflows

        >>> success, result = delete_command.execute()
        >>> assert success in [True, False]  # Both outcomes valid
    
    Error Handling:
        Comprehensive error scenarios covered:
        - Invalid member ID or non-existent members
        - Member deletion cancelled by user during confirmation
        - Database connection or transaction failures

    Return Value Patterns:
        Success scenarios:
        - (True, None): Member deleted successfully with confirmation displayed
        
        Failure scenarios:
        - (False, "Member deletion cancelled or failed"): User cancelled deletion
        - (False, "Member '{member_id}' does not exist"): Member not found
        - (False, str(exception)): Database or system errors
    
    Deletion Workflow Phases:
        1. Input Collection Phase:
           - Collect member ID through secure input service
           - Validate member ID format and existence
           - Handle user cancellation gracefully
        
        2. Validation Phase:
           - Verify member existence in database
           - Check for active bookings and dependencies
           - Validate deletion permissions and authorization
        
        3. Confirmation Phase:
           - Present deletion summary to user
           - Collect explicit confirmation for deletion
           - Handle confirmation cancellation appropriately
        
        4. Execution Phase:
           - Execute database deletion with transaction safety
           - Handle cascade deletion for related records
           - Verify deletion completion and data consistency
        
        5. Feedback Phase:
           - Provide immediate user feedback and confirmation
           - Display success messages or error guidance
           - Log operation for audit and monitoring purposes
    
    Security Considerations:
        - Multi-factor confirmation prevents accidental deletions
        - Input sanitization prevents injection attacks
        - Authorization verification ensures proper permissions
        - Comprehensive audit logging for security monitoring
        - Safe error handling preventing information leakage
    
    Business Rule Enforcement:
        - Member existence verification before deletion attempts
        - Active booking validation and cascade handling
        - Data integrity maintenance throughout process
        - Compliance requirements for audit trail preservation
        - Authorization verification for deletion permissions
    
    Performance Characteristics:
        - Efficient database operations with proper indexing
        - Minimal user interaction time through service delegation
        - Optimized validation procedures with fast lookups
        - Transaction boundaries optimized for consistency
        - Fast confirmation workflows suitable for interactive use
    
    Thread Safety:
        This command is stateless and thread-safe. Multiple concurrent
        deletion operations are supported through database-level transaction
        management and proper isolation mechanisms.
    
    Note:
        The command maintains separation of concerns by delegating input
        collection and confirmation to MemberInputService while focusing
        on deletion execution logic and database coordination.
