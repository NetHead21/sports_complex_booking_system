Update Member Password Command for the Sports Booking Management System.

This module implements the member password update functionality as part of the Command Pattern
architecture. It provides a highly secure and comprehensive interface for modifying existing
member passwords while maintaining strict security standards, encryption protocols, and proper
audit trail management throughout the sensitive password update process.

The command follows clean architecture principles by separating password update execution
from input collection and validation concerns. It leverages the MemberInputService for
secure password collection with advanced security measures, while the database manager
handles the actual update operations with enterprise-grade security protocols.

    >>> update_command = UpdateMembersPasswordCommand()
    >>> success, result = update_command.execute()
    >>> if success:
    ...     print("✅ Password updated successfully")
    ... else:
    ...     print(f"❌ Update failed: {result}")

        - Complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)
        - Password history tracking (preventing reuse of last N passwords)
        - Secure hashing using bcrypt, Argon2, or similar algorithms
        - Salt-based encryption preventing rainbow table attacks

    Example Usage:
        >>> # Standard password update workflow

        - Comprehensive security logging for monitoring and compliance

    Business Rule Enforcement:
        - Member existence verification before password update attempts
        - Password strength validation using organizational security policies
        - Password history verification preventing recent password reuse
        - Security event logging for audit trail compliance

            - Proper salt generation for each password
            - Configurable work factors for computational security
            - Secure random number generation for cryptographic operations
            - Protection against timing attacks and side-channel vulnerabilities

        Password Storage:
            - Never store plaintext passwords in memory or database
            - Secure hashed passwords with unique salts
            - Password history stored with same security standards
            - Encrypted audit logs for security monitoring

    Thread Safety:
        This command is stateless and thread-safe. Multiple concurrent
        password update operations are supported through database-level
        transaction management and proper isolation mechanisms with
        additional security considerations for sensitive operations.

    Note:
        The command maintains separation of concerns by delegating password
        collection and security validation to MemberInputService while focusing
        on secure update execution logic and encrypted database coordination.

        - Secure password input with real-time masking and protection
        - Password history tracking preventing reuse vulnerabilities
        - Industry-standard encryption with salt-based hashing
        - Input sanitization and validation processes
        - Safe error handling without password information leakage
        - Audit trail creation for security monitoring
        - Authorization verification workflows
    
    Password Security Testing:
        - Password complexity requirements enforcement
        - Minimum length validation and policy compliance
        - Character variety requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)
        - Password history verification preventing recent reuse
        - Secure hashing algorithm validation (bcrypt/Argon2)
        - Salt generation and cryptographic security verification
        - Memory cleanup and sensitive data protection
    
    Development Benefits:
        - Validates command implementation correctness with security focus
        - Demonstrates proper service integration with password security
        - Tests comprehensive password validation robustness
        - Provides usage examples for developers with security best practices
        - Verifies security measures and encryption effectiveness
    
    Note:
        This testing module demonstrates the clean separation between
        command execution logic, secure input collection services, password
        validation, encryption processing, and database operations, showcasing
        the benefits of service-oriented architecture with comprehensive
        security measures in sensitive member password management.
