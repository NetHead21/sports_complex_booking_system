"""
Update Member Email Command for the Sports Booking Management System.

This module implements the member email update functionality as part of the Command Pattern
architecture. It provides a secure and comprehensive interface for modifying existing
member email addresses while maintaining data integrity, validation standards, and proper
audit trail management throughout the update process.

The command follows clean architecture principles by separating email update execution
from input collection and validation concerns. It leverages the MemberInputService for
secure data collection and email validation, while the database manager handles the
actual update operations with comprehensive safety measures.

    - Email addresses must follow valid format standards
    - Email uniqueness must be maintained across all members
    - Update history must be preserved for audit requirements
    - Authorization verification for update permissions

Example:
    >>> # Execute member email update command
    >>> update_command = UpdateMembersEmailCommand()
    >>> success, result = update_command.execute()
    >>> if success:
    ...     print("✅ Email updated successfully")
    ... else:
    ...     print(f"❌ Update failed: {result}")

Data Validation Features:
    - Email format validation using industry standards
    - Domain verification and DNS lookup support
    - Duplicate email detection across member database
    - Input sanitization preventing malicious content
    - Business rule enforcement for email policies

Performance Considerations:

           - Provide immediate user feedback and confirmation
           - Display success messages or detailed error guidance
           - Log operation for audit and monitoring purposes

    Security Considerations:
        - Multi-factor validation prevents unauthorized email changes
        - Input sanitization prevents injection attacks and malicious content
        - Email uniqueness enforcement prevents account conflicts
        - Comprehensive audit logging for security monitoring
        - Safe error handling preventing information leakage

    Business Rule Enforcement:
